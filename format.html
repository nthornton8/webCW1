    <h3> Section Two </h3>
    <p>Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control over 
    the <br> way that a page is displayed. It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a 
    means <br> of marking up the structure of a document not as a way of determining its presentation. <br>
    Formatting text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from formatting text to appear <br>
    in a printed document.</p>

    This
    <hr>
    is
    Cool.
